Just experiments, will blog at some point

# TODO

- Switch to Maybe Type instead of EntityNotFoundException and findOrThrow
- More examples
- DTO to protect the domain entities? (I hate this part)
- Check where transaction handling should happen, is this in an interactor or
  outside? Does it matter?
